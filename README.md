# InteractiveHabitatSite
An interactive site designed to engage children with environmental features through the use of globes, maps etc. 

Initital basic .html files were converted to .java to run on a java local server.

Main features include an interactive heirachy tree using treantJS, an interactive globe using planetaryJS and google charts maps.

All split up into folders in this git. For advice on implementing any of these please contact me.
